# Sociophonetic Analysis & ML Pipeline: Trinidadian English
This repository contains a computational pipeline developed to analyze rhoticity variation across ethnic groups in Trinidad.

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Automated cleaning of acoustic formant data (F3) and handling of null values for non-rhotic tokens.
- **Phonological Contextualization:** Comparative analysis of word-medial vs. word-final environments.
- **Visualization:** Statistical distribution plots using Seaborn and Matplotlib to identify ethnic identity markers.

*Project serves as a bridge between traditional acoustic phonetics and modern data science workflows.*
